leaf node -- both pointer = NULL

queue-- style in notes needs MAX_QUEUE

%MAX_QUEUE - mod MAX_QUEUE lets us connect the front of the queue with the back in a circular way


assert front != back because its possible to overflow

process-near the top of the tree use queue
process-near the bottom of the tree use recursive
